      <p>During Brookline's Tuesday, May 3rd municipal election <em>245 Town Meeting Member seats</em> will be on the ballot.</p>

        <dt>What is Town Meeting?</dt>
        <dd>Town Meeting is the assembly of residents who decide the legislative policies of Brookline.</dd>

        <dt>Why so many seats this year?</dt>
        <dd>The results of the most recent U.S. Census prompted a redistricting process where every precinct (except precinct 16) changed by at least one Census block. If a precinct was altered by even one Census block, all 15 of its Town Meeting Member seats are to be voted on at the next Town election.</dd>

        <dt>Wait, redistricting happened?</dt>
        <dd>Indeed! Here is a <a href="https://www.brooklinema.gov/DocumentCenter/View/26965/Brookline-Precinct-Map-2022" class="usa-link usa-link--external">map of Brookline's new precincts and polling locations (PDF)</a>. Brookline grew from 16 to 17 precincts, the new 17th precinct being centered around Coolidge Corner.</dd>

        <dt>Where can I register to vote?</dt>
        <dd><a href="https://www.sec.state.ma.us/OVR" class="usa-link usa-link--external">Register to vote</a> on the Massachusetts Secretary of State's website.</dd>
