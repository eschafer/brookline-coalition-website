        <dt>Can I join BEC?</dt>
        <dd>You sure can! Here is <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd8oUbsHFUKdJgj2NmD-bH2tFztGdXuXxcC3zXfxqrvDip1ig/viewform">our onboarding form</a>.</dd>

        <dt>What is Town Meeting?</dt>
        <dd>Town Meeting is the 255-person assembly of elected representatives who decide the legislative policies of Brookline. Each year during the Town's May municipal election at least a third of each precinct's Town Meeting seats (5 positions) are on the ballot.</dd>
      
        <dt>Who are my Town Meeting members? Which precinct am I in?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Your precinct determines who your Town Meeting members are. As of re-precincting last year (following the latest census), <a href="https://www.brooklinema.gov/DocumentCenter/View/26965/Brookline-Precinct-Map-2022">Brookline has 17 precincts</a>. You can use the MA Secretary of State's website to <a href="https://www.sec.state.ma.us/WhereDoIVoteMA/WhereDoIVote">look up your precinct and polling place</a>.</p>
          <p>Once you know your precinct, you can cross reference that number with who this <a href="https://www.brooklinema.gov/DocumentCenter/View/6574">spreadsheet from the Town [downloads file]</a> lists as your fifteen Town Meeting members.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>What is the <a href="https://www.brooklinema.gov/343/Select-Board">Select Board</a>?</dt>
        <dd>The town's five-person chief executive body. Each Select Board member is elected by a Town-wide ballot for three year terms. The series is: two seats are up one year; the next year, two different seats are up; the third year, the fifth seat is up; and then the cycle repeats.</dd>
      
        <dt>When are the next elections?</dt>
        <dd>On Tuesday, September 6th <a href="https://www.raulforrep.com/">Raul Fernandez</a> — who is running to be the State Representative for the 15th Norfolk district — will be on the ballot. There is an election again on Tuesday, November 8th. And the next municipal election will be in May 2023.</dd>
      
        <dt>Where can I register to vote?</dt>
        <dd><a href="https://www.sec.state.ma.us/OVR">Register to vote</a> on the Massachusetts Secretary of State's website.</dd>
      
        <dt>What is charter change?</dt>
        <dd>Each municipality has a charter that outlines its local government's powers, functions, fundamental workings, and organization. Should Brookline want to write for itself a new charter — for example, so as to adopt city-style governance — <a href="https://www.mma.org/resource/how-to-go-about-a-charter-change/">charter change processes exist</a>. Massachusetts state law allows for either an elected charter commission or an appointed charter committee; see the link above for more details on each approach.</dd>
